Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a tutorial document to assist developers in virtualizing Axway API Gateways. Here are the steps to follow:

Prerequisites
Before you start virtualizing Axway API Gateways, you need to make sure you have the following installed:

Axway API Gateway
Axway Policy Studio
Step 1: Create a project
The first step is to create a project for your virtual API. To do this, open Axway Policy Studio and create a new project by selecting "File" -> "New" -> "Project".

Step 2: Add a virtual API
Once you have created your project, the next step is to add a virtual API. To do this, right-click on the "APIs" folder in your project and select "New API".

In the window that opens, enter the details of your API, such as its name, description, and version.

Step 3: Configure your virtual API
Once you have created your virtual API, the next step is to configure it. To do this, double-click on your virtual API to open its configuration.

In the configuration window, you can set parameters such as routes, endpoints, policies, etc.

Step 4: Test your virtual API
Once you have configured your virtual API, you can test it using Axway Policy Studio's built-in test function. To do this, click the "Test" button in the toolbar.

Step 5: Deploy your virtual API
Once you are satisfied with the operation of your virtual API, the final step is to deploy it. To do this, select your virtual API in the project view, right-click on it, and select "Deploy".

In the window that opens, select the server on which you want to deploy your virtual API and click "OK".

Conclusion
That's all there is to virtualizing Axway API Gateways using Axway Policy Studio. By following these steps, you should be able to create and deploy virtual APIs effectively.
