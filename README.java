To test a POST request on an API called Scoring, it is important to secure the request with a Bearer token. The token can be generated from a POST request on the endpoint {{baseUrl}}:8089/api/oauth/token. In order to generate the token, the body of the request should include the client_id and client_secret which are provided from the environment. Once the token is generated, it can be used to secure the POST request on the Scoring API. To do this, add the token to the Authorization header of the request with the value "Bearer {token}". This will ensure that the request is authenticated and authorized to access the Scoring API. By following these steps, you can ensure the security and integrity of your API requests.
