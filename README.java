Generating Collections for Newman:

Newman is a command-line companion tool for Postman that allows you to run and automate collections of API requests. To generate collections for Newman from Postman, follow these steps:

    Make sure you have created and saved all the requests you want to include in the collection within Postman.

    In the left sidebar of Postman, click on the "Collections" tab.

    Click on the collection that contains the requests you want to export for Newman.

    In the collection view, click on the "..." (three-dot) button located at the top-right corner of the collection details pane.

    From the dropdown menu, select "Export".

    In the export options, choose the desired format for your Newman collection. You can export it as JSON or as a Postman Collection v2 format.

    Choose the location where you want to save the exported file and click "Save" or "Export" to complete the process.

    You now have a collection file that can be used with Newman.

Running the Newman command-line tool:

To run the exported collection using Newman, follow these steps:

    Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

    Open your command-line interface (e.g., Terminal, Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved the exported collection file.

    Install Newman globally by running the following command:

npm install -g newman

    Once Newman is installed, you can execute the collection using the following command:

arduino

newman run <collection-file-path>

Replace <collection-file-path> with the actual path to your exported collection file.

    Newman will execute the collection and display the results in the command-line interface, showing the status of each request along with any test results.

By generating collections from Postman and using Newman, you can automate the execution of API requests, making it easier to incorporate API testing into your CI/CD pipelines or run automated tests.
